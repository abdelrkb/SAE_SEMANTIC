# SAE_SEMANTIC
The goal of this project is to create an online game called "Semantic Analogy Explorer" where one or more players engage in finding similarities between words. Each player is given a starting word and a target word, and they must propose similar words to create a chain connecting the starting word to the target word. The similarity between two words is assessed based on two criteria:

1. Semantic similarity: This refers to how closely related two words are in meaning. For example, "oboe" and "clarinet" are semantically similar as they are often used in the same context.

2. Orthographic similarity: This refers to how similar the spellings of two words are. For instance, "boat" and "castle" have similar spellings.

The score of a word chain corresponds to the similarity score of its weakest link. Regardless of the chain's length, the objective is to ensure that each word in the chain resembles the previous one as closely as possible.

In addition to the game itself, the application will feature a user account system where players can log in, track their past or ongoing games, and organize games with their contacts.
